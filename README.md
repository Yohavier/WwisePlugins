## Delay
In the /Delay folder is a simple delay that has a low shelf and a high shelf on the delayed signal. Currently those are hardcoded and cant be altered via RTPC'. But one can control the Feedback, Delay in ms and wet/dry ratio.

## Convolution 
Currently this one only supports Moving Average Interpolation.
